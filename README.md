# recommender for arXiv

This app will be able to do:
* search through arXiv.org and make recommendations based on the user's preference
* allow the user to create an account and save papers that they find useful
* automatically recommends papers based on the ones the user saved in their last login
* allow the user to rate a particular paper so that the system can *learn* their preference and make recommendations more precisely next time

Currently rewriting the core of this app. Frontend will be decided soon.
